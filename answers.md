The code responds to "I want to..." statements by taking what the user wants to do an putting "What would it mean to..." in front of it, in order to make the conversation more personalized. Something similar is done with "me" statements, but it replaces the "me" with "you" and asks another question with it. This makes Magpie seem more human.
