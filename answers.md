###New responses

'''
"simon" = "Simon is the coolest"
"scary" = "It's going to be okay"
"buy" = "How much will it cost?"
'''

When more than one keyword appears in the statement, the response is related to the first keyword that appear in the statement. Thus, in order to prioritize a keyword, you put it higher up in the 'if' statement.


#Question

1. If a keyword is included within another word in the statement, the code still considers the keyword to be included in the statement. Therefore, in the statement "I know all the state capitals" the response would be "Why so negative?" This is because the letters "no" can be found in the statement in the word "know." Also in the statement "I like vegetable smothered in cheese" the response would be "Tell me more about your family." This is because the keyword "mother" is still included within the statement.
