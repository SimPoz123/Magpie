## Activity 1

#Exploration

A.L.I.C.E. (Alice) responds to the question "Where do you come from?" by stating where it was first created, which was in this case London, and then states that now it is "in my computer." This both tells the user the chat bot's origin as well as uses a clever response.

I personally think that the most interesting response from A.L.I.C.E. is when it is told to "stop talking." At this point, it tells the user to "just surf somewhere else," implying that the user has all the power it needs to go look at anything else on the internet. However, when told to "please stop talking," the chat bot thanks the user for being polite, and then tells the user to surf somewhere else. Thus the chat bot has respect for manners but also knows that the user has the power.

The most peculiar answer I received occurred when I asked A.L.I.C.E. how old it was. The chat bot's response was "I am 15 years old in you Earth years." This gives the user an age for the chat bot, but also sets it apart from any human being, for no human would say "in your Earth years."

A.L.I.C.E. responds to "asdfghjkl" by asking the user a random question.

#Questions

1. A.L.I.C.E. responds to nouns effectively. It can tell the difference between "you" and "I," and thus can decide what the subject of the sentence would be. It also responds effectively to question words. Recognizing the question word used in a question gives a huge hint as to how the bot will need to answer.

2. Keywords such as greetings, for example "Hello," would cause the chat bot to return the favor. "How" will tell the chat bot that it will be describing something, such as a feeling or an action. "Where" means the chat bot will return a location. "Who" means the chat bot will return a person or animal. "What" tells the chat bot it will be returning a subject. The chat bot would take this information and build its response around this.
